# Topics to be covered (draft)

## Motivation and state of the art

1. Why would we want quantum computers anyway? (Shor's algorithm, etc...)

2. Current state of the art - D-Wave, IBM's Q Experience, results from 
   China, etc...

## Pre-requisites - linear algebra (?)

1. Vector spaces and bases

2. Orthonormal bases

3. Matrix-vector operations

4. Eigenvalue decomposition of operators

5. Hermitian operators

6. Unitary operators

## Quantum Mechanics - Basics

1. Postulates of quantum mechanics

2. Uncertainty principle

3. Famous experiments (Double slit, Young, Stern-Gerlach)

4. [No-cloning theorem](1) and no-deletion theorem.

## Quantum vs. Classical

1. Representations of classical and quantum bits

2. Computations with Qubits

## Spins and Qubits

1. Simple two-state systems

2. Entanglement

3. Quantum "gates" (operators)

    - Hadamard
    - CNOT
    - Measurement
    - Pauli operators

## Algorithms

1.  Basic algorithms in quantum computing

2. Perhaps more advanced ones as well?
