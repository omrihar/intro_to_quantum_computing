# Introduction to Quantum Computing

This repo is used to develop a mini-course in introduction to quantum computing
for developers. This course will be given internally in Schmiede.ONE. Any 
ideas, criticisms and contributions are very welcome!

Since I am learning about quantum computing as I go along, please consider 
everything in this repository as a draft status. All can be changed, enhanced 
and completely modified without prior notice.

The technical part of the presentation borrows extensively from the talk 
["Quantum Computing for Computer 
Sceintists"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM) from Microsoft 
Research. Some of the slides have been shamelessly copied, others have been 
modified. Since this is intended for internal use only, I hope this will not 
infringe on any copyright of anybody. If this is not the case, please inform me 
and I will remove this from my public Github repository.
