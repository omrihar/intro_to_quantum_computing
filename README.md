# Introduction to Quantum Computing

This repo is used to develop a mini-course in introduction to quantum computing
for developers. This course will be given internally in Schmiede.ONE. Any 
ideas, criticisms and contributions are very welcome!

Since I am learning about quantum computing as I go along, please consider 
everything in this repository as a draft status. All can be changed, enhanced 
and completely modified without prior notice.
