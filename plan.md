# Quantum Computing Talk - Plan

## Motivation

1. What do you know so far about QC?
2. Cryptography
3. Simulations of quantum systems

## (Following MS talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM)

1. Representation of cbits
2. Classical computation with linear algebra (and tensor states)
3. One and two bit operations (4 one bit and CNOT)
4. Classical bits to Quantum bits
5. Hadamard gate
6. Deutsch Oracle problem
7. Entanglement and Teleportation
8. Exponential storing of qbits as classical bits
9. Schor's algorithm and other algorithms
10. Quantum cryptography

## Demo (either Q# or quantumexperience or python q-library thingie)
